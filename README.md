## Getting Started

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to backend folder:

   ```bash
   cd authassignmentB
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create `.env` file:

   ```env
   PORT=5000
   DATABASE_URL=your_mySQL_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. Start backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

---

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to frontend folder:

   ```bash
   cd authassignment
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and visit:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## Form Validation Rules

- **Email** must be valid
- **Password** must be at least 6 characters
- **Confirm Password** (on signup) must match password

All validations are handled client-side with **Zod**, and server-side using **Express Validator / Custom Logic**.

---

## Sample Test User

```txt
Email: test@example.com
Password: test1234

Email: mytest021@gmail.com
Password: mytest
```

---

## Folder Overview

Both backend and frontend have modular, clean, and component-based file organization with clear separation of concerns.

---

## Design Decisions

- Used **React Query** for efficient and scalable API state management
- Employed **Zod** for elegant schema-based validation
- JWT stored in **localStorage** for maintaining login session
- Error messages shown instantly from server or validation schema
- CORS enabled in backend to allow secure cross-origin requests
